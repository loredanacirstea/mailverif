# email signed headers

Works with TinyGo.

* DKIM verification & signature - adapted from https://github.com/mjl-/mox
* ARC verification & signature
* novel protocol for notarizing manual forwarding of emails, heavily inspired from ARC signatures - docs https://wasmx.provable.dev/docs/architecture/provable_email_forwarding

If you are interested in the manual forwarding protocol, let me know. Development was paused due to a lack of funding. Turns out the EU does not want tools for stopping misinformation by email impersonation. Do not forget: a forwarded email is not a proof of authenticity and still, they are used today for this purpose.
